#P2P-File-Sharing-System
===
A peer to peer sharing application , Internet Protocols.
This application is a P2P file sharing system with a centralized index (CI).

The project goals:  
* Becoming familiar with network programming and the socket interface
* Creating server processes that wait for connections
* Creating client processes that contact a well-known server and exchange data over the Internet
* Defining a simple application protocol and making sure that peers and server follow precisely the
specifications for their side of the protocol in order to accomplish particular tasks
* Creating and managing a centralized index at the server based on information provided by the peers
* Implementing a concurrent server that is capable of carrying out communication with multiple clients
simultaneously
